# MagicHelpR

A package to help in performing QTL mapping in multiparent advanced generation intercross 
(MAGIC) lines.

The package was written to aid in analysing data from Arabidopsis, and is partially 
based on Richard Mott's scripts available at:
http://mus.well.ox.ac.uk/magic/

It also depends on the R package `happy.hbrem`, available on the same website. 
(instructions for its installation to follow).

To install this package just do:
```
#If not already installed, install devtools:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tavareshugo/MagicHelpR")
```

Will add an intro vignette in time.
